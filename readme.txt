There are few dependencies required in the project. It requires keras with the back-end as tensorflow. The project consist of two python files 1)model.py and 2) predicts.py. The model.py file trains the model. It takes around two to three hours to train the the model. I would request you not to execute the model.py  file unless you want to re train the model with different hyperparameters. 
In order to check the output predicted my the model execute "predicts.py" file using the command "python predicts.py". The code will genrate the predicted output of the model . The final output will consist only one line "predicted output - (output generate by model)".
